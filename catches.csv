The first case of diprosopus tetrophthalmus (cranofacial duplication) in a foetus of this species was reported from South Atlantic (Ref. 119190).|Circumglobal in temperate and tropical waters.  Western Atlantic:  Newfoundland, Canada to Argentina.  Central Atlantic.  Eastern Atlantic:  Norway to South Africa, including the Mediterranean.  Indo-West Pacific:  East Africa to Indonesia, Japan, Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand.  Eastern Pacific:  Gulf of Alaska to Chile.  Probably the widest ranging chondrichthyian.  Highly migratory species, Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (Ref. 26139).|Prionace glauca|221|400|https://biodiversidadacuatica.imarpe.gob.pe/Content/uploads/minifichas/PEZ.png
49|Tiburón espinoso|Dorsalspines(total): 0;Dorsalsoft rays(total): 0;Analspines: 0;Analsoft rays: 0;Vertebrae: 89. The prickly shark Echinorhinus cookei has thorn-like denticles on body which are moderately large (single denticles up to about 4mm in basal diameter in adults), numerous, regularly distributed, with scalloped basal margins, and never fused into compound plates.  Grayish brown in color, with black distal fin margins; white around mouth and on ventral surface of snout.  Tooth count 21-23/20-22.  Total vertebrae 89; precaudal 59.  As with the other member of the family Echinorhinidae, it has a relatively short snout and stout body; two small spineless dorsal fins, close together, towards posterior part of body and originating behind pelvic fin origin.  No anal fin and subterminal notch on caudal fin.  Small spiracles, very short labial furrows and teeth on both jaws alike, with a central oblique bladelike cusps with up to 3 cusplets on each side (absent in juveniles) (Ref. 247, 6871).|Western Pacific:  Japan (Ref. 6871), Taiwan, Palau, Australia (Ref. 6871) and New Zealand.  Eastern Pacific:  Hawaii, USA, Gulf of California, and from Costa Rica to Peru and Chile (Ref. 13564).  Also reported in Nicaragua (Ref. 13613).|Echinorhinus cookei|300|400|https://biodiversidadacuatica.imarpe.gob.pe/ImagenEspecies/Catalogo/366__19022019_1454.jpg
50|Tiburón renacuajo|Found on the upper continental slope and outermost shelf.  The expanded branchial region of this shark suggests that they are adapted to bottom areas with low dissolved oxygen levels.  With little information available, reproductive mode could either be ovoviviparous (Ref. 244, 53776) or oviparous, paired eggs are laid (Ref. 50449).|Eastern Central Pacific:  southern Baja California, Mexico and Gulf of California.  Cephalurus specimens from Panama, Peru and Chile differ from Cephalurus cephalus and may represent one or more new species.|Cephalurus cephalus|24|28|https://biodiversidadacuatica.imarpe.gob.pe/ImagenEspecies/Catalogo/1215__18022019_1502.jpg
51|Torpedo|Lives on the continental shelf, usually in very shallow waters.  Feeds on invertebrates and benthic fishes.  Ovoviviparous (Ref. 50449).  Maturity size of males usually at ca. 40 cm TL (Ref. 114953). The electric organs can produce a discharge of about 45 volts, depending on the size of the animal.  The discharge is used to stun prey and as defense against predators.|Eastern Pacific:  Costa Rica (Ref. 9264) and Chile (Ref. 9068).|Tetronarce tremens|90|90|https://biodiversidadacuatica.imarpe.gob.pe/ImagenEspecies/Catalogo/237__11042019_1209.jpg
52|Unicornio|Dorsalspines(total): 2;Dorsalsoft rays(total): 45-52;Analspines: 0;Analsoft rays: 47 - 53. Rudimentary pelvic spine disappears in large specimen (Ref. 36453).  Snout convex in adults (Ref. 1602).  Sandy to grey with small brown spots above; soft dorsal and anal fins pale yellowish to brownish; caudal membrane blackish brown (Ref. 4421).|Circumtropical.  Western Atlantic:  Massachusetts, USA to Argentina (Ref. 36453).  Eastern Atlantic:  west coast of tropical Africa (Ref. 3592).  Eastern Pacific:  Guatemala to Chile (Ref. 9068); probably in Mexico (Ref. 9318).  Western Indian Ocean:  Mozambique and South Africa (Ref. 4421).  Recently recorded from Reunion (Ref. 53568).|Aluterus monoceros|40|76|https://biodiversidadacuatica.imarpe.gob.pe/ImagenEspecies/Catalogo/273__11042019_1207.jpg
